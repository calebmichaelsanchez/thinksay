Text: L.A. based, Indiana born Chris Wallace actually shares his name with someone very well known from the music community - Notorious B.I.G.! The legendary rapper was born Christopher Wallace but his style is nothing like that if new pop artist Chris Wallace and that's a good thing - we love him!! His debut single Remember When (Push Rewind) is pure pop genius - intro and verse provide a good build up to a ripper Adam Lambert-esque chorus.
