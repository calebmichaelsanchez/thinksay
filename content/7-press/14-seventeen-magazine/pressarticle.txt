Text: After his former band The White Tie Affair broke up, Chris Wallace hit the studio solo. Now, his new song, "Remember When (Push Rewind)" is all over the radio. "I wrote it about a girl I was dating when my career started taking off," Chris told Seventeen when he stopped by recently. "There's a line in the song that says 'As my future got bright, we started losing light' and that's literally what happened. That was our turning point." But don't worry, Chris isn't moping around! "Eve though it's a sad song, it's almost a celebration, like 'Remember when that happened?' It sucks when relationships end, but [the memories] are still awesome."
