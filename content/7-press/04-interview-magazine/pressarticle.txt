Text: Hank Moody, the charismatically debauched novelist played by David Duchovny on Showtime's long-running series, Californication, has a habit of letting people down and a knack for charming his way back into their good graces. He's been a recurring disappointment to his on-again/off-again love, Karen (Natascha McElhone), and their teenage daughter, Becca (Madeleine Martin), but his boyish humor and lost-cause vulnerability have won him repeated chances at redemption.
