Text: As usual, everything goes back to a girl. Chris Wallace wrote his effervescent pop hit Remember When (Push Rewind) about the one he was seeing when his career took off. That relationship fell apart under the strain of pursuing pop stardom, but eternal optimist Wallace likes to look back at its best times. "As my future got bright, we started losing light, and I couldn't see that you were the one," he sings in the first verse of the song, which is No. 24 on USA TODAY's top 40 airplay chart.
