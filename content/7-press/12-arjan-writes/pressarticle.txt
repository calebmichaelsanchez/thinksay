Text: After rocking the scene as the frontman of Chicago pop-rock outfit The White Tie Affair, Chris Wallace has taken matters into his own hands and started work on an exciting solo project that is packed with pop. Check out a totally-guilt free MP3 of Wallace's debut single "Remember When (Push Rewind)" that will give you a good taste for his emerging brand of pop. The song has hit, hit, hit written all over with that irresistibly catchy "push, push, push" pre-chorus that is followed by a radio-ready chorus that packs a massive punch.
