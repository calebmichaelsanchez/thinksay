Text: Since the Boston Marathon bombings rocked this city, it seems that every facet of Boston's amazing community has come out in support of the victims.  At this very VIP rooftop event, the local music industry powerhouses came out in full force to make some music and support a dear friend.  Boston's music industry hosted this musical event to celebrate the City of Boston with special performances by Wyclef Jean and Chris Wallace on a roof top deck no more than a mile away from the finish line.  Think-say Records and Refugee La Republique - in conjunction with Global Entertainment, All Handz On Deck, SMG Management and Adrew Govatsos - united to create one amazing roofdeck jam to raise funds to support Karen Rand, one of hte many victims of the Boston Marathon devastation.
