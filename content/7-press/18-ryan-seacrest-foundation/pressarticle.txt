Text: Chris Wallace rocked out with patients in Seacrest Studio at Children's Medical Center of Dallas last Friday. The singer/songwriter visited the hospital after performing at South by Southwest in Austin. He performed several songs, including his pop hit Remember When, and answered questions from studio staff and patients.

Wallace talked about his childhood in Indiana where he began his music career. He played sports and asked his parents for a guitar after a sporting injury. "I really haven't looked back ever since," he said.  Wallace said he started a band without a PA system or singer, so he began singing. He continued singing and songwriting and received a record deal after posting a song on Myspace.  "Dreams do come true if you work hard enough," he said.
