Text: In short, over the last few years, Matt White’s music career can be summed up like this: A few albums, a few record labels, a consistent flow of licensing placements through tv, film and advertising and on top of that, a substantial amount of songwriter’s credits on successful tracks he penned for other artists, including Enrique Iglesias, Jennifer Lopez, Lana Del Ray, Jason Derulo and Cody Simpson.

And now? Matt White is taking both his major and indie label experience and combining them with his city boy smarts, dry sense of humor and the key ingredient that has been the constant through his career, his slightly rough around the edges, undeniable heart... resulting in a new album for the people who may have heard him on a street corner, on their tv or radio, at one of his live shows or for those whom are sure to be a new part of the nextchapter.
