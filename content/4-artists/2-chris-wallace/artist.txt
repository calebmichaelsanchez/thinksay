Text: "There weren't many places you could go and get loud so I just sang in my car. When people ask me today how I'm able to sing so loud I tell them it's because I just got used to trying to sing above Freddy Mercury blasting on my car stereo. I would drive around town for hours singing at the top of my lungs. It was the only place I could go to let it out!"                                                         
-Chris Wallace on growing up in Hebron, Indiana

One of the first things you learn about Chris Wallace is that he dreams BIG. His oversized presence practically screams with confidence and a sense of control beyond his years, and he puts it all on full display as he preps for the release of his first solo album, due this summer. Coming out of the gate strong, Chris is already receiving the kind of reception that artists dream about: Upon hearing Chris' new music, MTV added Chris directly into Buzzworthy rotation and proclaimed that, "Critics are going so far as to call him the male Katy Perry, a compliment if we ever heard one. Actually, we totally agree!"
