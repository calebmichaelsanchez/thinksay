Text: Born and raised in New York City, David Duchovny emerged to become one of the most highly acclaimed actors in Hollywood. The star of Fox Television's monster hit THE X-FILES, David was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series. His other long running series CALIFORNINCATION ended its 7 year run this past summer for Showtime. Hank Moody marked another seminal character portrayed by David that has made it's way into our pop culture lexicon and for whose portrayal he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Comedy series. The press and the public both agree that Duchovny brings a fierce intellect, a quiet intensity and an acerbic wit to his roles on both the small screen and the silver screen. 

David is currently working on his first studio album for ThinkSay Records and will be distributed by Universal Music Group, the album will be released in April 2015.
