Text: "SAM!! NO TEXTING and driving. Sorry now I'm ready. Welcome to ThinkSay where Jerry Maguire meets Music. I'm writing this first blog post from the backseat where Kerry, Sam, A to Z and I are headed to NYC to hear some final rough cuts on David Duchovny's first record!

We just finished recording in Boston a couple weeks ago, http://bit.ly/1GzqRoU, and everyone here at ThinkSay is excited to deliver this record in 2015!

After lunch in the studio we are going to see our friends and associates at Global, Jerry and Tony. Jerry has some new music Wyclef Jean has been working on when he was in studio with Avicci.

Then it's back to Boston for a meeting with the director for the Matt White "Love" video.

Lots to do before year ends but ThinkSay is looking to have a big 2015 with lots of announcements coming!

More later, need gas and an iced tea.
